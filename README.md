# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Ryan DeMatteo

This mock-up photo-sharing layout was created with the intention of building a website with responsive design. Using @media queries, I designed the site work at any resolution. There were two resolutions provided in the Figma design. These resolutions were developed to specification. I enjoyed having flexibility to make decisions on design elements at different breakpoints between. Referencing [Screen Size Map](https://screensizemap.com/), I considered what every user would experience when visiting the site.

The project is compliant with Flat BEM practices. It utilizes a combination of flexboxes and grid layouts. The photo-sharing container is designed to expand with the addition of of content. Font-sizes are scaled to shrink with the site's resolution.
