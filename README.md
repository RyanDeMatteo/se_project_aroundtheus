# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Ryan DeMatteo

This mock-up photo-sharing layout was created with the intention of building a website with responsive design. Using @media queries, I designed the site work at any resolution. There were two resolutions provided in the Figma design. These resolutions were developed to specification. I enjoyed having flexibility to make decisions on design elements at different breakpoints between. Referencing [Screen Size Map](https://screensizemap.com/), I considered what every user would experience when visiting the site.

The website is made dynamic using JavaScript. Users can add new cards to their
stream and change user options. All information runs through an authentication process, and does not make amendments to HTML. The project is constructed using modular Javascript and Classes

The project is compliant with Flat BEM practices. It utilizes a combination of flexboxes and grid layouts. The photo-sharing container is designed to expand with the addition of of content. Font-sizes are scaled to shrink with the site's resolution.
